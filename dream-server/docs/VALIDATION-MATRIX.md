# Dream Server Validation Matrix

Last updated: 2026-05-21

This page describes the layered coverage used to validate Dream Server between
changes. It is intentionally sanitized: it publishes hardware classes,
operating systems, GPU paths, and test phases without private hostnames, LAN
addresses, usernames, or filesystem paths.

## Layered Test Surface

Dream Server uses three standing validation layers:

| Layer | Where it runs | Coverage | What it proves |
|---|---|---|---|
| CI matrix | GitHub Actions containers | Ubuntu 24.04/22.04, Debian 12, Linux Mint 21.3, Fedora 41, Rocky 9, Arch, Manjaro, CachyOS, openSUSE Tumbleweed | os-release parsing, package-manager detection, installer syntax, and dry-run logic |
| Fleet distro lab | tower2 Docker containers + Incus VMs | 10 container distros plus VMs for Ubuntu 24.04, Fedora 42, Rocky 9, Arch current, and openSUSE Tumbleweed | fast distro breadth plus real systemd, network, Docker daemon, Compose, and installer dry-run with Docker enabled |
| Real hardware fleet | Private local machines | Linux NVIDIA, Linux AMD, Linux ARM NVIDIA, macOS Apple Silicon, Windows laptop | fresh installs, GPU runtime, dashboard, Hermes, UI, lifecycle, and agent capabilities |

Containers are breadth, not user-experience proof. Incus VMs add systemd,
kernel, and Docker-daemon realism, but they still do not prove GPU runtime.
Physical fleet machines remain the release gate for accelerator and product
behavior.

## Hardware Surface

| Test surface | OS family | Architecture | Accelerator path | Memory class | Fleet role |
|---|---|---:|---|---:|---|
| Linux NVIDIA workstation | Ubuntu 24.04 | x86_64 | Dual high-memory Blackwell CUDA GPUs | 90 GB+ VRAM per GPU | Primary multi-GPU CUDA install, dashboard, UI, and capability target |
| Linux AMD unified-memory workstation | Ubuntu 24.04 | x86_64 | AMD Strix Halo / ROCm-Lemonade path | 120 GB+ unified | Primary AMD install/runtime validation target |
| Linux NVIDIA unified-memory appliance | NVIDIA Ubuntu derivative | aarch64 | Grace Blackwell / CUDA path | 120 GB+ unified | ARM Linux + NVIDIA appliance validation target |
| macOS constrained Apple Silicon | macOS | arm64 | Native Metal inference + Docker services | 16 GB unified | Smoke gate and tight-memory macOS validation target |
| macOS high-memory Apple Silicon | macOS | arm64 | Native Metal inference + Docker services | 120 GB+ unified | Large-model macOS validation target |
| Windows hybrid GPU laptop | Windows 11 + Docker Desktop/WSL2 | x86_64 | NVIDIA mobile GPU plus Intel Arc integrated GPU | 32 GB+ system RAM | Windows installer, Docker Desktop, WSL2, and mobile-GPU validation target |

This standing hardware fleet is the repeatable release surface for GPU and
product behavior: it can run in parallel whenever installer, bootstrap,
dashboard, agent, model, or extension code changes. The CI matrix and tower2
distro lab add repeatable distro evidence between hardware fleet runs.
Community and volunteer testers add broader coverage on other GPUs, distros,
operating-system versions, storage layouts, and network environments, but those
reports are complementary evidence rather than the always-on release gate.

## Fleet Phases

The private fleet harness runs these phases and records structured artifacts for
each host where the phase is applicable.

| Phase | What it proves | Normal cadence |
|---|---|---|
| Regression replay | Previously fixed fleet bugs have not returned | Every full fleet run |
| Smoke gate | The smallest Apple Silicon target can fresh-install and pass core health before the larger fleet starts | Every full fleet run |
| Preflight | OS, RAM, disk, Docker, firewall, port conflicts, prior install state | Every install run |
| Fresh install | The public bootstrap path can nuke prior state and install non-interactively | Every full fleet run |
| Core verify | Dashboard API, dashboard UI, llama-server models/chat, and Hermes proxy are reachable | Every post-install run |
| Dashboard API flows | Model listing, model download/switch, and extension install state transitions | Every post-install run |
| Hermes auth/chat | Magic-link session auth, gated Hermes access, and seed echo through the agent path | Every post-install run |
| Browser UI | Dashboard navigation, model/extension surfaces, and Open WebUI model proxy behavior | Default UI target every run; scheduled wider UI sweeps |
| Capability probes | Chat coherence, web search, file write/read, code execution, skills list, and loaded-model identity | Every post-install run, with LLM probes deferred while bootstrap is still active |
| Lifecycle | Reinstall, restart, and doctor checks after state changes | Release-candidate or explicit lifecycle runs |

## Representative Evidence

The 2.5.0 release-candidate fleet run on 2026-05-21 passed in
`/home/michael/dream-fleet-test/runs/2026-05-21T15-48-27Z`. The run exercised
tower2, Strix Halo, Spark, Mac mini, and M5 MacBook Pro with fresh install,
7/7 verify, Hermes seeded echo, UI checks, and applicable capability probes.
Strix Halo and the M5 MacBook Pro fully proved capability probes on
Qwen3.6-35B-A3B; the Mac mini fully proved capability probes on Qwen3.5-9B;
tower2 and Spark deferred capability probes while still in bootstrap mode.
Regression replay finished 9/9 fixtures green with 0 bugs detected and 0 PRs
opened.

The same release-candidate pass included the distro lab. The Docker matrix
validated 10/10 distros: Ubuntu 24.04, Ubuntu 22.04, Debian 12, Linux Mint
21.3, Fedora 41, Rocky 9, Arch, Manjaro, CachyOS, and openSUSE Tumbleweed.
Linux Mint and Fedora hit transient I/O contention while tower2 was also doing
a heavy fleet install, then passed cleanly on solo retry. The Incus VM matrix
validated 5/5 VMs: Ubuntu 24.04, Fedora 42, Rocky 9, Arch current, and
openSUSE Tumbleweed, each booting real systemd + Docker and running the
installer dry-run cleanly.

Earlier 2026-05-21 distro-lab work also surfaced infrastructure and
product-relevant issues: tower2 needed Incus bridge/firewall allowance, and
Rocky-family installs needed a Docker CE fallback when distro packages were not
available. The harness also previously surfaced an external DNS/download
failure on one macOS run, which is evidence that environment failures are
visible rather than silently converted into product passes.

The Windows laptop is part of the validation surface so Windows + Docker
Desktop/WSL2 + mobile NVIDIA/Intel hybrid GPU behavior is not inferred from
Linux or macOS results. Treat Windows evidence as release-relevant only when
the Windows target produces preflight, install, verify, dashboard, and UI
artifacts for the release candidate being claimed.

## What This Proves

- Installer OS and package-manager logic is exercised across 10 Linux distro
  lanes in CI/container form.
- Systemd, network, Docker daemon, Docker Compose, and installer dry-run
  behavior are exercised in disposable Incus VMs for the major Linux families.
- The installer is repeatedly exercised on real machines, not only CI
  containers and VMs.
- The release path covers heterogeneous GPU vendors, memory sizes, operating
  systems, and CPU architectures.
- The harness records environment state before install so firewall, Docker,
  disk, DNS, and port issues can be separated from product bugs.
- The user-facing path is tested beyond service liveness: dashboard actions,
  model switching, Hermes auth, agent capabilities, and regression fixtures are
  part of the gate.

## What This Does Not Claim

- Every Linux distribution is exhaustively installed on real hardware for every
  change. CI containers and the tower2 distro lab cover broad distro logic and
  systemd/Docker VM behavior; the physical fleet covers the high-value hardware
  paths.
- The Incus VM matrix is not GPU validation. GPU runtime claims require real
  NVIDIA, AMD, Intel, or Apple hardware evidence.
- OS and distro rotation is periodic because reprovisioning real machines is
  intentionally slower than running the standing fleet. Release notes should
  call out any rotated distro or OS image that was included for that candidate.
- Intel Arc is still experimental unless a release cites a successful Arc fleet
  run for that release candidate.
- AP-mode and packaged appliance handoff still require target-image validation
  because router, Wi-Fi, mDNS, and client-device behavior vary.
- A fresh fleet pass is not a long-term soak test. Bench, thermal, and
  overnight stability runs are separate evidence.

## Release Readiness Receipt

Before a release is described as ready, the release notes should cite:

- the Dream Server version and matching Git tag or release;
- the fleet run date and sanitized hardware classes covered;
- regression replay result;
- install/verify/dashboard/Hermes/capability result summary;
- any skipped, deferred, blocked-by-environment, or not-run phases;
- known gaps that should not be read as supported behavior.

The version signal should be internally consistent before publication:
`manifest.json`, the changelog section, the Git tag/release, and any release
notes should all name the same version. If a candidate has not been tagged yet,
describe it as unreleased or release-candidate evidence rather than as a shipped
stable release.
